# AI‑Duel — Two AI models enter, one answer leaves  
*A collaborative debate engine for LLMs*

AI‑Duel is an open‑source concept and backend skeleton for a tool where two different language models (e.g., GPT‑4, Gemini, Claude, Groq) are placed into the same “arena” to solve a user‑defined task.

The user provides a single task → both AIs respond → they see each other’s answers → they refine their reasoning → and finally produce a combined, improved answer.

---

## 🔥 What is this?

AI‑Duel is:

- a **debate engine** for two LLMs  
- where the models:
  - answer the task
  - see each other’s responses
  - improve their own answer over several rounds
  - and finally produce a **joint summary**

Goal: combine the strengths of two different models into one superior result.

---
## ✨ Features

- **Two‑model debate loop**  
  Runs a structured back‑and‑forth between two LLMs (Model A vs Model B).

- **Multi‑round refinement**  
  Each model sees the other’s previous answer and improves its own.

- **Final combined answer**  
  After the debate rounds, one model produces a synthesized, improved conclusion.

- **Extensible backend skeleton**  
  Clean FastAPI structure that developers can easily extend with real LLM APIs.

- **Model‑agnostic design**  
  Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Google, or any other LLM provider.

- **Simple, hackable architecture**  
  Clear orchestrator logic that anyone can modify or build upon.

- **Open‑source and MIT‑licensed**  
  Free to use, modify, fork, and integrate into other projects.
## 🧠 How it works

1. The user sends to the API:
   - the task (`task`)
   - the model names (`modelA`, `modelB`)
   - number of rounds (`rounds`)

2. The backend:
   - calls both models with the task
   - on the next round, feeds each model the other model’s previous answer
   - repeats this for 2–4 rounds
   - finally asks one model to produce a summary

3. The API returns:
   - round‑by‑round debate history
   - the final combined answer

The debate loop between two models.

### `requirements.txt`
Python dependencies.

## 🚀 How to continue development

This repository is intentionally lightweight so any developer can:

- add real API calls (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Groq…)
- build a frontend (React, Svelte, Vue…)
- add model selection UI
- improve the debate loop
- create a visual “AI arena” interface

If you want to continue the project, fork it and go wild.
